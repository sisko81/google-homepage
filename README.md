I decided to try the <span style="color:blue;">G</span>oogle search result page from '<strong>The Odin Project</strong>', it's the difficult version and optional but why not give it a shoot.
HTML and CSS will be used of course thats the scoop of my knowledge at the moment.Focusing on placement and alignment my goal.
All of this is fun almost like magic.
